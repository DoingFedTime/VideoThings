## What is Speculative Execution?

Modern CPUs use a technique called **pipelining** to execute instructions faster. Instead of waiting for one instruction to completely finish before starting the next, different stages of multiple instructions (like Fetch, Decode, Execute, Commit) overlap.

However, **branch instructions** (like `if`/`else` statements in code) pose a challenge. The CPU doesn't know which path the code will take until the branch condition is evaluated in the Execute stage. Waiting would stall the pipeline and slow things down.

**Speculative Execution** is the solution:
1.  **Prediction:** The CPU's **branch predictor** guesses which path the branch will likely take (e.g., based on past behavior).
2.  **Speculation:** The CPU *speculatively* fetches and executes instructions from the *predicted* path *before* knowing if the prediction is correct.
3.  **Verification:** When the branch instruction actually executes, the CPU checks if the prediction was right.
    *   **Correct Prediction:** The speculative work was useful! The results are kept, and the pipeline continues without stalling, saving time.
    *   **Incorrect Prediction:** The speculative work was wasted. The CPU **discards** the results of the wrongly executed instructions (flushes the pipeline) and starts fetching/executing instructions from the *correct* path. This incurs a small penalty, but it's often faster than always waiting.

The animation in `index.html` demonstrates this process, showing instructions moving through the pipeline stages, the prediction at a branch, speculative execution, and the handling of both correct and incorrect predictions.

## Security Implications (Spectre & Meltdown)

While speculative execution boosts performance, it opened the door to security vulnerabilities like **Spectre** and **Meltdown**.

These attacks exploit the fact that even though the *results* of incorrectly speculated instructions are discarded, the execution *itself* can still leave subtle side effects in the CPU's cache memory.

*   **How it works (Simplified):** An attacker crafts malicious code that tricks the CPU into speculatively executing instructions that access sensitive data (e.g., passwords, keys) that the code *shouldn't* normally have access to. Even though the CPU later realizes the speculation was wrong and discards the direct result, the act of accessing the sensitive data might slightly change the timing of subsequent memory accesses (due to caching).
*   **Side-Channel Attack:** The attacker then uses precise timing measurements (a "side channel") to infer information about the sensitive data based on these subtle cache timing differences.

Essentially, these attacks cleverly use speculative execution to leak information that should be protected. Mitigations involve software patches and hardware changes, often with some performance trade-offs.
