# Gas Chromatography Interactive Animation

An interactive animation that demonstrates how gas chromatography separates chemical compounds based on their retention time and interaction with the stationary phase.

## Features

- **Step-Based Animation**: Walks through each stage of the gas chromatography process.
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, reset, and control animation speed dynamically.
- **Chromatogram Output**: Visualizes detector output with animated peaks corresponding to compound elution.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for teaching core concepts in analytical chemistry.
- **Dark-Themed UI**: Designed with a modern, responsive, dark-style interface.
- **No Dependencies**: Built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoingFedTime/VideoThings.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd VideoThings/gas chromatography
```

3. Open the `gc-animation.html` file in your web browser.
4. Click "Start Animation" to simulate the gas chromatography process.

## Customization

- **Retention Times**: Adjust molecule animation timing in the script to simulate different compound behaviors.
- **Peak Display**: Modify the `createPeak` function to change peak height, labels, and timing.
- **Styling**: Update theme colors and layout in the CSS section to match your desired visual design.
