## Features

- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Simulates each major phase of mass spectrometry.
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, reset, and adjust animation speed.
- **Clear Visualization**: Displays ion generation, magnetic separation, detection, and mass spectrum output.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to teach the principles of mass spectrometry simply and effectively.
- **Modern Styling**: Fully responsive design with dark theme aesthetics.
- **Pure Client-Side**: Implemented using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoingFedTime/VideoThings.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd VideoThings/mass spectrometer
```

3. Open the `mass-spectrometer.html` file in your preferred web browser.
4. Press "Start Animation" to begin the simulation.

## Customization

- **Animation Speed**: Adjust the range or behavior of the speed control slider in the JavaScript section.
- **Ion Data**: Modify the `peaks` array inside the script to simulate different molecules or fragmentation patterns.
- **Styling**: Update CSS variables or component classes to change theme colors, layout, or typography.
